## 🌟 What is Soc Ops?

**Soc Ops** transforms networking events from "please kill me now" to "hey, this is actually fun!" 

It's a **social bingo game** where players race to find people matching prompts on a 5×5 grid. First to get 5 in a row wins — but everyone wins when they make genuine connections.

Perfect for:
- 🏢 **Team building** events and corporate mixers
